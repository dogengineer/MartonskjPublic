      <description>The Alfa Romeo V6 engine (also called the Busso V6) was a 60Â° V6 engine made by Alfa Romeo from 1979 to 2005. It was developed in the early 1970s by Giuseppe Busso, and used on the Alfa 6 with a displacement of 2.5 L (2,492 cc) and a SOHC 12-valve cylinder head. Later versions ranged from 1,997 to 3,195 cc (1.997 to 3.195 L) and had DOHC 24-valve valvetrains. The original design had short pushrods for the exhaust valves in a design similar to earlier Lancia Fulvia engines.</description>
